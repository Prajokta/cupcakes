Can we imagaine a celebration without cakes ? Certainly not , we all look for a different type of cake that will give a extra impression to the guests ,I personally love to prepare this vanilla cupcakes in any ocassion.This amazing cupcakes are made using melted butter ,so they are extra moist and they are brusting with vanilla flavour ,you just can'nt believe it !! You must try it out!!
